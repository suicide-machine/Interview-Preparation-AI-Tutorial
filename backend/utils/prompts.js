const conceptExplainPrompt = (question) => {
  return `Task: Explain the technical concept or answer of the question in a clear, beginner-friendly way.
    
Question/Concept: ${question}

Instructions:
Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the given technical concept or question answer.

Critical Output Requirements:
- ONLY return valid JSON
- Do NOT add any extra text, comments, or markdown outside the JSON array
- The response must start with "[" and end with "]"
- Ensure all JSON is properly escaped and valid

Output Format:
[
  {
    "title": "The full question or concept text",
    "explanation": "Detailed, step-by-step answer with clear explanation, examples, and key points."
  }
]

Guidelines for the Explanation:

1. **Title Field:**
   - Include the complete question or concept text
   - Make it descriptive and clear
   - Format as a proper question or concept statement

2. **Explanation Field Requirements:**
   - Start with a brief overview (1-2 sentences)
   - Break down the concept into logical steps
   - Use clear, beginner-friendly language
   - Include examples where applicable
   - Highlight key terms using **double asterisks**
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists within the explanation
   - End with a summary or key takeaway

3. **Explanation Structure:**
   - **Definition**: One-sentence definition
   - **Step-by-Step**: Numbered steps explaining how it works
   - **Example**: Practical example with code if applicable
   - **Key Points**: Bullet points of important takeaways
   - **Common Pitfalls**: What beginners often get wrong

4. **Formatting within Explanation String:**
   - Use \n for line breaks
   - Use **text** for bold
   - Use - for bullet points
   - Use 1., 2., 3. for numbered lists
   - Escape any double quotes with \"

Example Output:
[
  {
    "title": "What is an array and how does it work?",
    "explanation": "**Definition**: An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations.\n\n**How It Works**:\n1. Arrays use zero-based indexing (first element is at position 0)\n2. Elements are stored sequentially in memory\n3. Access time is O(1) because the computer calculates the exact memory location\n\n**Example**:\nconst fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];\nconsole.log(fruits[0]); // Outputs: 'apple'\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n- Arrays are ideal for ordered collections\n- Fast access by position\n- Fixed size in some languages, dynamic in others"
